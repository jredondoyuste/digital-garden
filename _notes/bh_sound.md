title: Black Hole Concerto
---

An orchestra sits ready. The first violin makes their entrance as the audience claps and sits and puts their phones away. Swiftly the whole string section joins for a jolly A note, a steady note, a colourful note as the winds and the brasses take over. From the left side of the stage, a conductor waltzes to the podium in a sucession of measured steps. Lagging behind walks the solist carrying a strange instrument. Little is known about this - except that it is meant to shake and vibrate with the fundamental frequencies of spacetime itself. You are attending the first black hole concerto. 

Welcome to my [[dream]].
