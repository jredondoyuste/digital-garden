title: On Tonality
---

I find twelve-tone music generally quite interesting, but somehow unable to provoke in me the same emotional response that tonal or even polytonal (Rite of Spring) can. Perhaps I just haven't found the right piece. Perhpas I should [[bh_sound|write my own]]

More on this -- I have been giving some listens to Berg's Violin Concerto. It definitely grows on me the more I listen or read about it. But should music (art) require such effort from the audience?
